# Hello Robot Workshop

Welcome to the "Hello Robot" workshop GitHub repository! ü§ñ Unleash the power of robotic arms as we dive into the exciting world of robotics. This repository provides you with all the necessary MATLAB and CAD files to explore and implement the designing techniques learned during the workshop.

## Workshop Details:

- üìÖ **Date:** 7th Jan 2024
- üïí **Time:** 2:00 PM
- üìç **Venue:** LH302

## Workshop Highlights:

1. **Design Flow:**
   - Gain insights into the fundamentals of design, including Cadding, Actuation, and Microcontroller selection.
  
2. **Real-world Applications:**
   - Apply the fundamentals to design a robotic arm from scratch.

3. **Hands-on Experience:**
   - Utilize SolidWorks for CAD design.
   - Implement simulation using MATLAB Simulink, exploring PID controllers.

## Repository Contents:

- üìÅ **MATLAB:**
   - Contains MATLAB files for simulation and control algorithms.
   - Explore PID controller implementations and simulation scripts.

- üìÅ **CAD:**
   - SolidWorks files for the robotic arm design.
   - STEP or STL files for 3D printing, if applicable.

## Getting Started:
